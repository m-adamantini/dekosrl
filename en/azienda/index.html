      </h2>

      <p class="split-par" style="margin-top:22px; max-width:52ch;">
        Ingenuity, know-how and curiosity define the character of Pierino Brunelli,
        founder and driving force behind Deko Srl. A chemical technician born in 1951
        with a strong entrepreneurial spirit, he built over forty years of experience
        in the development of non-stick coatings for cookware.

        In 1994, with the invention of the sanding machine, he revolutionized the sanding process,
        almost completely eliminating pollution while doubling productivity.

        In 2004, he founded Deko. From that moment on, leveraging accumulated know-how
        and expertise shared with the team, the company rapidly established itself
        among the world’s leading players in non-stick cookware coatings
        and multiple industrial applications.
