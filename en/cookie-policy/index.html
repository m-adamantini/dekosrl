        <h2>What are cookies</h2>
        <p>
          A cookie is a text file stored on computers, tablets, mobile phones, and any device used to browse the Internet,
          capable of storing user navigation information and preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some cookies can be used to make browsing easier and to personalize the user’s experience on the platform by identifying them when they use it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some cookies can indicate which sections of the platform are visited most often, helping to evaluate the effectiveness of communication and awareness campaigns,
          the dissemination of institutional news and services provided, and improving what can be offered to the user.
        </p>
        <p>
          DEKO Srl complies with the provisions of the Italian Personal Data Protection Code (“Privacy Code”), as amended by Legislative Decree no. 69 of 28 May 2012,
          implementing European Directive 2009/136/EC, and in accordance with EU Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR).

        <h2>Types of cookies</h2>
        <p>
          Cookies can be classified as follows:
        </p>

        <ul class="policy-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Session (or temporary) cookies:</strong> they expire or are deleted when the browser is closed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Persistent cookies:</strong> they have longer expiration times (from a few minutes up to several months), depending on the functions they perform.
            These functions distinguish cookies into two categories: technical and non-technical (or profiling).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Technical cookies:</strong> they manage data necessary to deliver pages and facilitate navigation—for example, avoiding re-entering usernames and passwords to access certain services,
            remembering the last page visited or how far a video was watched, recognizing the device type and adapting image sizes accordingly.
            Technical cookies may also be used for aggregated, anonymous statistical analyses of the most visited pages and user preferences, and are not used to analyze individual behavior or preferences.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Profiling cookies:</strong> these are persistent cookies used to identify (anonymously or otherwise) user preferences and improve the browsing experience.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>First-party cookies:</strong> cookies delivered directly by the operator of the platform you are browsing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Third-party cookies:</strong> cookies delivered by third parties when the platform relies on external services for specific functions.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <ul class="policy-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Browsing cookies:</strong> to allow the user to view this platform, make it work correctly, and log in to restricted areas.
            These cookies are essential for the proper functioning of the platform.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Functional cookies:</strong> to remember user preferences and help users use the platform more effectively—for example, by storing previously viewed services and events.
            Functional cookies are not essential for the platform to operate, but they add services and improve the overall browsing experience.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Analytics cookies:</strong> to better analyze how users use the platform in order to optimize and improve it, and to ensure that it is always effective and efficient.
